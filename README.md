This is a personal project named 'Burger Builder App' which is  built using React and some third party libraries for example Redux and React-Router.

It is a Single Page App built using React's class based components. It is 100% responsive and can be viewed on all devices such as tab/mobile.

With this app a user can place an order for a burger. User can build a burger by adding ingredients they want with their price, like salad and meat. 
Then they will be proceeded to checkout page where they can view the burger on a Modal. Then they can fill their personal information on a form having
validations. Finallyth, they can place an order which will be stored on the Firebase database. Also, implemented authentication wherein user can signup and
signin and then after logging in they can also view the orders placed from their account previously as it will be fetched from the Firebase server. 
Also implemented React-router for routing to different pages.

This project uses all the major front-end application concepts such as authentication, form validation, routing also webpack, some advanced CSS features and 
it's libraries, testing, animations, Redux Saga and the latest React Hooks.
React Hooks is a latest React feature available from React 16.8 which implements state management and Lifecycle features using only functional components.
Earlier this was only possible through Class based components.

It also uses Firebase's backend database to implement get and post request.
