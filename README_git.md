This is Burger Builder App using React and it's third party libraries for example Redux and React-Router.

It is a Single Page App built using React's class based components.

This project is a practice app provided by the tutorial at Udemy by Maximilian Schwarzmuller.

It uses all the front-end application concepts such authentication, form validation, routing, webpack, some advanced CSS features and it's libraries, testing, 
animations, Redux Saga and the latest React Hooks.
React Hooks is a latest React feature available from React 16.8 which implements state management and Lifecycle features using only functional components.
Earlier this was only possible through Class based components.
